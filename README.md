# Multiplication quiz

This is a small webapp that generates quiz from the multiplication of two 2-digit numbers. It is currently running live at [jonathan-at-knocki.tech](https://jonathan-at-knocki.tech). The quizzes do not require any login but there is an admin console to see previous quizzes You can login via test@knocki.com/knocki (e-mail/password); once logged in, you can create more admin users via the link in the admin panel.

Thank you for your consideration!
